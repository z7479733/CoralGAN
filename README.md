# CoralGAN
This is the CoralGAN code. The corresponding paper is 《A novel data augmentation method based on CoralGAN for prediction of part surface roughness》.
CoralGAN_first_class.m is the main program, first_class is a minority sample of the surface roughness samples, and the dimension of the sample is 1251.
CoralGAN learns and generates minority samples in the surface roughness sample data.
